These are the instructions on using the project files.
-Before running the simulations, import the workspace file into MATLAB.
-To run the simulation for constant value reference tracking, run the Aircraft_Q_learning file.
-To run the simulation for time dependent reference tracking, run the Aircraft_Q_learning_v2 file.
-Run LQR_longitudinal before Aircraft_Q_learning_v2
